I watch three climb before it's my turn.  It's a tough one.  The guy before me tries twice.   He falls twice.     
After the last one,  he comes donw. He's finished for the day.  It's my turn.   My buddy says "Good Luck!" to me.     
I noticed a bit of a problem.    There's an outcrop on this one.     It's about halfway up the wall.
